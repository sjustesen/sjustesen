### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Here you'll find my - mostly - unfinished projects that I hack on when time allows. 

I work with a variety of programming languages, no particular favorites (maybe leaning a bit towards Rust and C/C++/C#), 
which is why you'll discover in my repos that I'm all over the place with no clear "direction" LOL.
